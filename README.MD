## Twitter graph data analysis using Neo4j.

Most graph processing systems end up focusing on simple algorithms (Shortest Paths,
PageRank) that are not really used by real graph analysts. 

For this project, we studied [Stanford Network Analysis Project](http://snap.stanford.edu/snap/description.html)
to identify common patterns of accesses made by different network algorithms, and designed a minimal
`wrapper` over a Twitter graph database that can support a subset of these operations.
