Twitter graph data analysis using Neo4j.

Most graph processing systems end up focusing on simple algorithms (Shortest Paths,
PageRank) that are not really used by real graph analysts. 

This project will study Stanford Network Analysis Project (http://snap.stanford.edu/snap/description.html)
to identify common patterns of accesses made by different network algorithms, and design a
wrapper over a Twitter graph database that can supports a subset of these operations.
